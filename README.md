AngularTwitterClone
===================

This is a program I made after week 3 of Coder Camps when we learned the Angular framework.  We were asked to emulate
 a simpler version of Twitter.  I was able to add the following functionality using the database, Firebase.
 Update my profile page (pic, bio userName, Url), add friends (see their profile), see their tweets (with time and pic),
 and write my own tweets where others can see them.
